# smart-gas-and-flame-detector
## 📖 Overview
This project implements an **IoT-based Fire and Gas Detection System** using a **Master–Slave Arduino architecture**.  
The system continuously monitors **fire and gas leakage** and triggers an **alarm (buzzer)** when danger is detected.

- **Master Arduino UNO R4** → Reads sensors and makes decisions  
- **Slave Arduino UNO R4** → Controls the buzzer based on Master signal  

This design improves **reliability, modularity, and scalability**.
